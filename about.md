# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo.
I started learning **Python** in January 2018 and I think I am picking up this skill very fast.
The motivation to learn python surfaced when I needed a different analytical method for my research.
I was constructing network graph using NodeXL and could do much about customizing the visualization.
