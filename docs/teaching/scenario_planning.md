# Scenario Planning

## Course Instructor Schedule
Instructor: Jude H. Kurniawan
Office: EV1-246
Office Hour: TBA
Class Schedule: TBA

## Calendar Description
The course examines various futures research methodologies and how they are embraced as scenario methods by researchers and practitioners. The emphasis is on developing competence in facilitating and organizing a scenario planning workshop using the appropriate scenario methods.

## Course Overview
Events and trends affecting the future could cause chained impacts in which the potential interconnections between events are becoming more significant in terms of their magnitude and the speed of the occurrence, largely due to the accelerated emerging changesâ€”social, technological, and political changes. This sort of cascading effects is difficult to be intuitively and cognitively mapped, let alone forecasted. Insofar, policymakers and stakeholders must still deal with deep uncertainties in exercising judgment and making decisions. Over the last few decades, scenarios have emerged as an important tool for decision-making under deep uncertainties. The objective of scenario planning is to engage policymakers and stakeholders to be involved in the development of scenario plots and that they will recognize the importance of uncovering and deliberating the implications of the future scenarios. The motivation for involving stakeholders in scenario development is to obtain insight and creativity from a pool of experts that otherwise would be inaccessible to the scenario researchers and the public.
