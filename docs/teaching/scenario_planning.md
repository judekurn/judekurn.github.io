Instructor: Jude H. Kurniawan

Office: EV1-246

Office Hour: TBA

Class Schedule: TBA

## Calendar Description
The course examines various futures research methodologies and how they are embraced as scenario methods by researchers and practitioners. The emphasis is on developing competence in facilitating and organizing a scenario planning workshop using the appropriate scenario methods.

## Course Overview
Events and trends affecting the future could cause chained impacts in which the potential interconnections between events are becoming more significant in terms of their magnitude and the speed of the occurrence, largely due to the accelerated emerging changes—social, technological, and political changes. This sort of cascading effects is difficult to be intuitively and cognitively mapped, let alone forecasted. Insofar, policymakers and stakeholders must still deal with deep uncertainties in exercising judgment and making decisions. Over the last few decades, scenarios have emerged as an important tool for decision-making under deep uncertainties. The objective of scenario planning is to engage policymakers and stakeholders to be involved in the development of scenario plots and that they will recognize the importance of uncovering and deliberating the implications of the future scenarios. The motivation for involving stakeholders in scenario development is to obtain insight and creativity from a pool of experts that otherwise would be inaccessible to the scenario researchers and the public.

## Learning Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, students will:
* Understand various scenario methods, their strengths, and limitations
* Be able to design scenario process and scenario planning workshops
* Experience the process of planning and organizing a scenario planning workshop
* Learn to facilitate a scenario planning workshop

## Material
Software:
* [ScenarioWizard 4.2](http://www.cross-impact.de/english/CIB_e_ScW.htm) – application software (free) for cross-impact balance analysis developed by ZIRIUS Centre for Interdisciplinary Risk and Innovation Studies at the University of Stuttgart.

Journals:
* Methodological oriented journals: [Environmental Modelling and Software](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/environmental-modelling-and-software) and [Technological forecasting and social change](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/technological-forecasting-and-social-change/)
* Generalist journals: [Foresight](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/loi/fs), [Futures](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/futures), [Journal of future studies](http://jfsdigital.org/)

## Assignments
**Workshop Proposal** (Assignment 1): Students will write a brief proposal (800 words) for a scenario planning workshop which highlights (1) project goal, (2) process design, and (3) scenario content.

**ScenarioWizard** (Assignment 2): Students will work in groups and select one workshop proposal to develop. Students will then conduct environmental scanning for 4-5 scenario drivers related to the topic they proposed. These drivers will be subjected to cross-impact balances analysis using an application software called ScenarioWizard.

**Scenario Planning Workshop** (Assignment 3): Students will work in groups to design and organize a participatory scenario planning workshop. Students will be allocated 45 minutes to conduct facilitation of their proposed workshop. The groups will then submit their final paper describing the scenario narratives (storylines) developed during the workshop they facilitated (2500 words).
