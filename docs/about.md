# About Me
I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Waterloo, Department of Geography and Environmental Management, and hold Energy Council of Canada’s Energy Policy Research Fellowship. I am currently researching new approaches for developing multi-scale scenarios and applying those techniques for constructing Canada’s low-carbon energy futures. This work is also supported by Canada’s Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). Together with my doctoral advisor, Dr. Vanessa Schweizer, I co-authored an article presenting a systematic approach of multi-scale scenario analysis. His forthcoming publication explores how social influences on transport system would shape the expectations of the future of urban mobility in Singapore. I graduated from Northeastern University with Bachelor of Science and University of Waterloo with Master of Climate Change.
