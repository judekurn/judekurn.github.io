# Digital Data for Social Science
The design of this course is highly influenced by the course taught by John McLevey ("[Big Data and Social Science](http://www.johnmclevey.com/475/)" at the University of Waterloo) which I attended. Some aspects of this course also resonate with the course by Laura Nelson ("[Digital Methods for Social Sciences and Humanities](http://www.lauraknelson.com/p/teaching.html)" at Northeastern University).

## Course Instructor Schedule
Instructor: Jude H. Kurniawan

## Calendar Description

## Course Overview


## Learning Objectives
The schedule section of the syllabus identifies the core learning objectives for every scheduled topic in the course.

## Materials
## Books:
Two books will be used extensively, Salganik and Foster et al. For students who are not familiar with Python, it is rudimentary to read Severance and practice along while watching his youtube tutorial videos.

>Matthew Salganik. 2018. [Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/). Princeton University Press. Currently free to read online.
>
>Ian Foster, Rayid Ghani, Ron S. Jarmin, Frauke Kreuter, Julia Lane (eds). 2016. Big Data and Social Science: A Practical Guide to Methods and Tools. CRC Press.
>
>Charles Severance. 2016. [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book.php). Available for free online.
>
>Ryan Mitchell. 2015 / 2018. Web Scraping with Python: Collecting Data from the Modern Web. O’Reilly. This is optional.

If you have no previous knowledge of HTML or CSS, you might consider getting yourself a copy of Jon Duckett’s (2011) [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites.](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) It’s a nice (and beautiful) introduction that assumes no prior knowledge. Of course there are plenty of great resources online. You don’t need to buy the book. Your web scraping skills will advance rapidly as you become more familiar with HTML and CSS.

## Computing:
All students need to bring their laptops to every class. Let me know if this is an issue.
## Software:
Before coming to class, all students must install [Anaconda for Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your laptop. Anaconda will install most of Python pacakges for data science including Jupyter Notebook, which will be the "work space" for students in all lecture and tutorial sessions. As the lesson progresses, students will be asked to install other packages (e.g. metaknowledge, spaCy, gensim etc) as required.

**Important: All the computing we do in this course will be in Jupyter Notebooks**

## Session 10: MACHINE LEARNING AND COMPUTATIONAL TEXT ANALYSIS (PART ONE)
I want to dedicate three full sessions for ML and NLP. Familiarity with the application of ML and NLP for computational text analysis in social science is rudimentary. As this is not an ML course per se, I assume students would have thouroghly read up and practice the basic of ML. I expect students to get their hands dirty and learn the hard way. Please come to class prepared...be very prepared! By the end of this class, you should be able to (1) characterize the general types of problems that machine learning methods can address, (2) describe how machine learning fits into the larger analysis landscapes of data science and computational social science, (3) prepare unstructured text for a computational analysis.

>Gabe Ignatow and Rada Mchalcea. 2018. Pages 99 - 130 in Text Mining: Research Design, Data Collection, and Analysis. SAGE. Chapters cover basic text processing and supervised learning. It is fine to skim the chapter on supervised learning methods. I want you to have a high-level understanding of the general processes and goals. We will get into specific methods later, using concrete examples of applications.
