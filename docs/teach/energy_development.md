# ENERGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

The design of this course is highly influenced by the Renewable Energy and Sustainable Development course at Murdoch University and Energy & Sustainability at the University of Waterloo.

## Course Instructor Schedule
Instructor:	Jude H. Kurniawan (hkurniawan at uwaterloo.ca)

Office:		EV1-246

Office Hour:	TBA

Class schedule:	TBA

## Calendar Description
The course addresses the challenges of designing, assessing and introducing small-scale sustainable energy technologies in developing countries, particularly in rural areas. Topics covered include cook-stoves, standalone home solar systems, biogas, biodigesters, small-scale wind and micro-hydro technologies.

## Course Overview
Energy is an essential input for sustainable development that leads to improvement in quality of life. Access to energy brings many benefits including poverty alleviation and human development. Considering the environmental impacts related to the conventional energy provisions, renewable energy resources appear to have the potential in providing effective solutions. Renewable energy offers many advantages for rural communities; however, the track record of renewable energy projects in such communities has been mixed due to a series of technical, social, economic and contractual problems many of which are specific to the indigenous community context. Hence the focus of this course is the capacity building rather than the about technology aspects.

## Learning Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, students will:
* Be able to explain the current methods of energy provisions in developing countries particularly rural areas and identify problems they cause.
* Critically assess and design a small scale renewable energy technologies suitable for rural and indigenous communities.
* Be able to approach problems with energy poverty holistically, i.e. applying key criteria such as social/cultural, technical, economic and environmental aspects to assess the issues.
* Be able to assess key elements that affect the successful introduction of sustainable renewable energy technologies in a development setting.

## Assignments
* Project Outline: Students will write a brief outline (800 words) for a proposed project covering title, major content sections and bibliography.
* Assignment 1: Tutorial
* Assignment 2: Tutorial
* Project: Students will prepare a consultant report on the best strategy for implementing lighting program. The World Bank wishes to know various options for improving lighting in the village households and the cost of these options. The report must evaluate the feasibility, cost, advantages and disadvantages of the proposed systems (3000-4000 words).
