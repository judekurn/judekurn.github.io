# Digital Data for Social Science
The design of this course is highly influenced by the course taught by John McLevey ("[Big Data and Social Science](http://www.johnmclevey.com/440/)" at the University of Waterloo) which I attended and also marked the beginning of my journey into a new scholarship of computational social science. Some aspect of this course also resonates with the course by Laura Nelson ("[Digital Methods for Social Sciences and Humanities](http://www.lauraknelson.com/p/teaching.html)" at Northeastern University).

Upon successful completion of this course, students will:

## Materials
### Books:
Two books will be used extensively, Salganik and Foster et al. For students who are not familiar with Python, it is rudimentary to read Severance and practice along while watching his youtube tutorial videos.
* Matthew Salganik. 2018. [Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/). Princeton University Press. Currently free to read online.
* Ian Foster, Rayid Ghani, Ron S. Jarmin, Frauke Kreuter, Julia Lane (eds). 2016. Big Data and Social Science: A Practical Guide to Methods and Tools. CRC Press.
* Charles Severance. 2016. [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book.php). Available for free online.
* Ryan Mitchell. 2015 / 2018. Web Scraping with Python: Collecting Data from the Modern Web. O’Reilly. This is optional.

### Computing:
All students need to bring their laptops to every class. Let me know if this is an issue.
### Software:
Before coming to class, all students must install [Anaconda for Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your laptop. Anaconda will install most of Python pacakges for data science including Jupyter Notebook, which will be the "work space" for students in all lecture and tutorial sessions. As the lesson progresses, students will be asked to install other packages (e.g. metaknowledge, spaCy, gensim etc) as required.

## Lecture Schedule
### Week 1: Introduction / Getting started with Jupyter
This class meeting will introduce the core themes and learning objectives for the term. By the end of the class, you should (1) know what the key themes of the course are, (2) be able to clearly explain what I expect from you in the course, and (3) understand what you need to do to succeed. 
>Chapter 1 “Introduction” from Bit by Bit
>Supplementary / Optional: Chapter 1 “Introduction” from Big Data and Social Science
>Supplementary / Optional: David Lazer and Jason Radford. 2017. “Data ex Machina: Introduction to Big Data.” Annual Review of Sociology 43:19-39.
>Supplementary / Optional: Dalton Conley et al. “Big Data. Big Obstacles.” The Chronicle Review.
>Supplementary / Optional: Eszter Hargittai. 2015. “Is Bigger Always Better? Potential Biases of Big Data Derived from Social Network Sites.” The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 659(1).
### Week 2:
By the end of this class, you should be able to (1) explain how social scientists and data scientists use digital data in observational studies, and (2) describe the 10 common characteristics of “big data” discussed in Salganik: big, always on, nonreactive, incomplete, inaccessible, non-representative, drifting, algorithmically confounded, dirty, and sensitive.
