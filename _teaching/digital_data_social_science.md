# Digital Data for Social Science

## Course Description
The design of this course is highly influenced by the course taught by John McLevey ("[Big Data and Social Science](http://www.johnmclevey.com/440/)" at the University of Waterloo) which I attended and also marked the beginning of my journey into a new scholarship of computational social science. Some aspect of this course also resonates with the course by Laura Nelson ("[Digital Methods for Social Sciences and Humanities](http://www.lauraknelson.com/p/teaching.html)" at Northeastern University).

## Learning Objectives

## Computing and Software
Before coming to class, all students must install [Anaconda for Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your laptop. Anaconda will install most of Python pacakges for data science including Jupyter Notebook, which will be the "work space" for students in all lecture and tutorial sessions.
