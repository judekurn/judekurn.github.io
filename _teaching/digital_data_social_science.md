# Digital Data for Social Science
The design of this course is highly influenced by the course taught by John McLevey ("[Big Data and Social Science](http://www.johnmclevey.com/440/)" at the University of Waterloo) which I attended and also marked the beginning of my journey to computational social science. Some aspects of this course also resonate with the course by Laura Nelson ("[Digital Methods for Social Sciences and Humanities](http://www.lauraknelson.com/p/teaching.html)" at Northeastern University).

## Materials
### Books:
Two books will be used extensively, Salganik and Foster et al. For students who are not familiar with Python, it is rudimentary to read Severance and practice along while watching his youtube tutorial videos.
* Matthew Salganik. 2018. [Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/). Princeton University Press. Currently free to read online.
* Ian Foster, Rayid Ghani, Ron S. Jarmin, Frauke Kreuter, Julia Lane (eds). 2016. Big Data and Social Science: A Practical Guide to Methods and Tools. CRC Press.
* Charles Severance. 2016. [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book.php). Available for free online.
* Ryan Mitchell. 2015 / 2018. Web Scraping with Python: Collecting Data from the Modern Web. O’Reilly. This is optional.

### Computing:
All students need to bring their laptops to every class. Let me know if this is an issue.
### Software:
Before coming to class, all students must install [Anaconda for Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your laptop. Anaconda will install most of Python pacakges for data science including Jupyter Notebook, which will be the "work space" for students in all lecture and tutorial sessions. As the lesson progresses, students will be asked to install other packages (e.g. metaknowledge, spaCy, gensim etc) as required.

By the end of this class, you should be able to (1) explain how social scientists and data scientists use digital data in observational studies, and (2) describe the 10 common characteristics of “big data” discussed in Salganik: big, always on, nonreactive, incomplete, inaccessible, non-representative, drifting, algorithmically confounded, dirty, and sensitive.

### Session 3: GETTING STARTED WITH PYTHON
By the end of this class, you should be able to (1) assign things to variables, (2) execute code conditionally, and (3) explain what a function is, use built-in functions, and understand when, why, and how you might want to write your functions.
