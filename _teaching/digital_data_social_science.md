# Digital Data for Social Science
The design of this course is highly influenced by the course taught by John McLevey ("[Big Data and Social Science](http://www.johnmclevey.com/440/)" at the University of Waterloo) which I attended and also marked the beginning of my journey into a new scholarship of computational social science. Some aspect of this course also resonates with the course by Laura Nelson ("[Digital Methods for Social Sciences and Humanities](http://www.lauraknelson.com/p/teaching.html)" at Northeastern University).

## Course Overview


## Learning Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, students will:

## Materials
### Books:
Two books will be used extensively, Salganik and Foster et al. For students who are not familiar with Python, it is rudimentary to read Severance and practice along while watching his youtube tutorial videos.
* Matthew Salganik. 2018. [Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/). Princeton University Press. Currently free to read online.
* Ian Foster, Rayid Ghani, Ron S. Jarmin, Frauke Kreuter, Julia Lane (eds). 2016. Big Data and Social Science: A Practical Guide to Methods and Tools. CRC Press.
* Charles Severance. 2016. [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book.php). Available for free online.
* Ryan Mitchell. 2015 / 2018. Web Scraping with Python: Collecting Data from the Modern Web. O’Reilly. This is optional.

### Computing:
All students need to bring their laptops to every class. Let me know if this is an issue.
### Software:
Before coming to class, all students must install [Anaconda for Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your laptop. Anaconda will install most of Python pacakges for data science including Jupyter Notebook, which will be the "work space" for students in all lecture and tutorial sessions. As the lesson progresses, students will be asked to install other packages (e.g. metaknowledge, spaCy, gensim etc) as required.

## Lecture Schedule
### Session 1: INTRODUCTION
This class meeting will introduce the core themes and learning objectives for the term. By the end of the class, you should (1) know what the key themes of the course are, (2) be able to clearly explain what I expect from you in the course, and (3) understand what you need to do to succeed. 
>Chapter 1 “Introduction” from Bit by Bit

>Supplementary / Optional: Chapter 1 “Introduction” from Big Data and Social Science

>Supplementary / Optional: David Lazer and Jason Radford. 2017. “Data ex Machina: Introduction to Big Data.” Annual Review of Sociology 43:19-39.

>Supplementary / Optional: Dalton Conley et al. “Big Data. Big Obstacles.” The Chronicle Review.

>Supplementary / Optional: Eszter Hargittai. 2015. “Is Bigger Always Better? Potential Biases of Big Data Derived from Social Network Sites.” The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 659(1).

### Session 2: SOCIAL SCIENCE WITH DIGITAL DATA
By the end of this class, you should be able to (1) explain how social scientists and data scientists use digital data in observational studies, and (2) describe the 10 common characteristics of “big data” discussed in Salganik: big, always on, nonreactive, incomplete, inaccessible, non-representative, drifting, algorithmically confounded, dirty, and sensitive.
>Chapter 2 “Observing Behavior” from Bit by Bit

### Session 3: GETTING STARTED WITH PYTHON
By the end of this class, you should be able to (1) assign things to variables, (2) execute code conditionally, and (3) explain what a function is, use built-in functions, and understand when, why, and how you might want to write your functions.
>Chapter 1 “Why should you learn to write programs?” from Python for Everyone

>Chapter 2 “Variables, expressions, and statements” from Python for Everyone

>Chapter 3 “Conditional execution” from Python for Everyone

>Chapter 4 “Functions” from Python for Everyone

>Supplementary / Optional: Watch and follow along with Jessica McKellar’s “[A Hands-On Introduction to Python for Beginning Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkx5_MRAV3A).” If you have no previous Python background, I recommend watching and following along with McKellar’s tutorial before coming to class.

>Supplementary / Optional: Watch Brian Granger, Chris Colbert, and Ian Rose’s 2017 talk “[JupyterLab: The Evolution of the Jupyter Notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7jq4XgwLJQ)” to get a sense of what you can do with Jupyter Lab.

### Session 4: GETTING STARTED WITH PYTHON
By the end of this class, you should be able to (1) understand iteration in Python, (2) manipulate strings, and (3) understand basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, and tuples).
>Chapter 5 “Iteration” from Python for Everyone

>Chapter 6 “Strings” from Python for Everyone

>Chapter 8 “Lists” from Python for Everyone

>Chapter 9 “Dictionaries” from Python for Everyone

>Chapter 10 “Tuples” from Python for Everyone

### Session (optional): AGENT-BASED MODELS IN PYTHON
These sessions will (1) review some of the fundamental theory and concepts information agent-based models and other simulation methods in the social sciences, (2) review the paradigm of object-oriented programming, and (3) explain how to develop simple agent-based models in Python.
>Macy and Willer (2002) “From Factors to Actors: Computational Sociology and Agent-Based Modeling.” Annual Review of Sociology. 28:143-166

>“What Is Agent-Based Modeling?” from Wilensky and Rand (2015) An Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling

>Nicky Case’s online game “[The Evolution of Trust](http://ncase.me/trust//).” Take about 30 minutes to play .
