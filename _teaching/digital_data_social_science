# Digital Data for Social Science

## Course Description
The design of this course is highly influenced by the course I attended taught by John McLevey ("[Big Data and Social Science](http://www.johnmclevey.com/440/)" at the University of Waterloo) which also marked the beginning of my journey into a new schoarlship of data science. Some aspect of this course also resonates with course by Laura Nelson ("[Digital Methods for Social Sciences and Humanities](http://www.lauraknelson.com/p/teaching.html)" at Northeastern University).
