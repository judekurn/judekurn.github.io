	<h1>Foresight Research - Jude Kurniawan!</h1>
	<p>I research methods for studying the future in the complex world today. Howver, I don't claim to be a <em>futurist</em> like many people do. If you want to know more about me, see <a href="/docs/about">here to read more about me.</a></p>
	<p>Currently, I am completing my Ph.D. at the University of Waterloo and I research various factors (socio-technical and socioeconomic) that could promote or resist Canadaâ€™s transition to a low-carbon energy future. I have worked using different research methods on various foresight projects such as future of energy (using expert elicitation, visioning, quantitative scenario analysis), future of urban mobility (focus group discussions, participatory scenario planning), and future of work/technologies (horizon scanning, Delphi).</p>
